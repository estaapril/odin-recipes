# odin-recipes

This project is a simple HTML recipe website created as a review of
my web development skills. Having previous experience with HTML
in college, this project helps me refresh and practice key concepts
such as:

- Structuring web pages with HTML elements
- Linking between pages
- Using lists and images effectively

This README also serves as a reflection on the skills I'm revisiting
and reinforcing while completing this project.
